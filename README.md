# ACoP-2018-Workshop

## PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® (OSPS®) workshop on integrating PBPK with QSP

esqLABS is running a one-day hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshop on **integrating PBPK with QSP** on **Saturday October 6, 2018** at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort near **San Diego**, CA, **United States** (For details on the workshop venue see [ACoP9 registration site](http://www.acop7.org/)). The workshop covers the concepts and application of combining PK-Sim, MoBi and R to build your very own digital platforms for the prediction of clinical trial outcomes by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge to translate early in-vitro and preclinical outcomes to the clinic. During hands-on exercises you will learn how to:

- [x] Build a PBPK model in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
- [x] Integrate mechanism-based pharmacodynamics in MoBi
- [x] Simulate and analyze your PBPK-QSP model in R

This workshop will be held jointly by consultants & scientists from esqlabs GmbH and Bayer AG with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

**Cost**: 700 USD. We offer a reduced price of 350 USD for academics & non-profit organization employees to cover breakfast, lunch and coffee breaks. 

**REGISTRATION**: You will register via the [ACoP9 registration site](http://www.acop7.org/). For more information on the workshop, please email Stephan on workshop@esqLABS.com. We will update this site with more details on the workshop in due time.
